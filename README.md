# Project #5. Restaurant Reviews

The **Restaurant Reviews** Project is the last self-paced project in _Udacity Nanodegree Program_.

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, it is required to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application: from the static design that lacks accessibility to the design that is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.

It is also required to add a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for the users.
